## Insights
In Q4 2024, New York increased renewable energy generation by approximately 9% compared to 2023, strengthening its clean energy transition. Chicago recorded a 19% decline in renewable energy generation, accompanied by a 27% rise in non-renewables, indicating growing dependency on fossil fuels. Atlanta showed stability, with an insignificant 1% decline in renewable energy and a 12% increase in non-renewables, raising concerns about maintaining renewable capacity. Across all three cities, total energy expenditure reached $2M, with Chicago incurring the highest costs indicating opportunities for efficiency improvements. Overall, 59% of energy came from renewable sources and 41% from non-renewables, reinforcing the need for sustained investment in renewable infrastructure to advance urban sustainability goals.
